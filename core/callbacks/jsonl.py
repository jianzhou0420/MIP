"""JsonlLogger — the episode trajectory file, episode_{i}.jsonl.

One line per bus event, ``{"t": <s since episode start>, "kind": …,
**payload}``, flushed as written so a live ``tail -f`` sees every event.
The vocabulary is whatever the adapters emit (core.bus); this class only
persists it. Opened fresh per episode (a resume that re-runs an index
overwrites; a rate-limit retry's previous attempt is archived by the
runner first). Without it there is no episode_{i}.jsonl — run_stats and
the monitor go blind, the summary record still lands.
