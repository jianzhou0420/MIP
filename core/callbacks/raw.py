"""RawLogger — the harness-native stream, raw/episode_{i}.jsonl.

Every record an adapter hands to ``sink.raw`` (a Claude SDK message as
``{"type": <class>, "msg": …}``, a codex event as ``{"event": …}``; mini
has no raw stream) written verbatim, one JSON line each, ``ensure_ascii``
off as the adapters wrote it before 2026-09-09. Opened on the first record,
so an adapter that emits none leaves no file. This is what CostLogger and
reporting/run_stats read per-API-call usage from; without it the cost
split by tool and the token curves are gone, the CLI-settled totals stay.
