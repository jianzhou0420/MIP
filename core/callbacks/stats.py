"""StatsReport — stats.json + stats.html after the last episode.

Fires on_run_written (it reads summary.json, episode_{i}.jsonl and raw/
from disk) and delegates to reporting.run_stats.generate — charts, per-tool
cost apportioning, per-episode notes. Best-effort: a failed report never
loses a run. Without it: no stats files; backfill any time with
``python coding-agent/reporting/run_stats.py <run_dir>``.
