"""Task shapes — the per-episode semantics between the loop and the harness.

A shape answers five questions the loop cannot: how an episode is PLACED
(which env-panel pushes, what reset returns, what the briefing embeds),
what the arm's briefing builder needs to know, what the FIRST prompt is,
how the episode is EVALUATED (which verb, which inputs, the judge on the
free-form lines), and what extra fields the episode record carries. The
loop (runner.Runner.run_episode) calls these in order and never tests a benchmark
name; the env picks its shape per task family with one config literal
(``env.shapes.<family>: pkg.mod.Class`` in the experiment file).

Every shape is a subclass of ``TaskModule`` with a registry name (its
``shape`` attribute; ``core.shapes.SHAPES``). Built-ins: nav · objnav · eqa
· express · manip · real for the legacy env families and es.* for the
EmbodiedScore-envs stack (core.shapes.es). An env that needs more than a
built-in names its own class in ``shapes``.

Removing a shape removes the envs that declare it — nothing else changes.
