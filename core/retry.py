"""RetryPolicy — the rate-limit retry the run loop applies per episode.

An episode whose session ended in a provider rate limit is re-run in
place, with exponential backoff, up to ``max_attempts`` times; the
previous attempt's files are archived (``*.attempt{k}*``, see
runner.archive_attempt) so nothing is lost. "session limit" / "usage
limit" = the 5 h subscription window (resets on a clock, not transient) —
a retry cannot clear it within the window, but tagging it routes the
episode to error="rate_limited" -> excluded from the board (not scored 0
as a navigation failure).
