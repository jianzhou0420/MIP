"""coding-agent/api — the API layer, abstracted out of the harnesses.

Folder rule (code-style.md §Folder Hierarchy): caller shallow, callee deep.
The ROOT holds what requests actually hit and the machinery that makes those
endpoints exist — wire gateways (``anthropic_wire`` / ``openai_wire`` over
``service.LoopbackService``) and local model serving (``ollama`` / ``vllm``).
The bottom subfolder ``providers/`` holds pure knowledge of who is being
called (vendor identity, keys, wire, default endpoints). Imports point
strictly downward.

Entry points — the only import surface for outside code:

- ``provider_of(model_id, extra)`` — vendor resolution.
- ``gateway_for(spec, wire, tag)`` — cross-API seats: a harness speaks its
  NATIVE wire to a foreign vendor through a wire gateway. Engaged only for
  cells whose extra carries ``("api_gateway", "litellm")``; native pairings
  keep their own call paths.
- ``fake_gateway_for(spec, tag)`` — the scripted endpoint of an ``api=fake``
  run (``fake_wire``): a real harness, no model.
- ``ensure_serving`` / ``serving_log_offset`` / ``serving_audit`` — local
  model serving, dispatched by provider identity. The dispatch lives HERE,
  not on the providers: the bottom layer stays declarative.
