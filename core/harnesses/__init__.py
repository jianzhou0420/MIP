"""Harness adapters — one per closed/open agent stack.

Each adapter implements core.episode.HarnessAdapter: run ONE clean session
for one episode, emitting through the shared EventBus. Everything else
(placement, prompts, evaluation, artifacts, summary) lives in runner.py,
core.shapes and core.callbacks. ``fake`` is the token-free scripted harness
for wiring checks (core.harnesses.fake) — never a board seat; to check a REAL
adapter without a model, ``api=fake`` points it at the scripted endpoint
instead (core.api.fake_wire).

An adapter is instantiated by runner.py from the ``agent.harness`` block of
the experiment config (``_target_`` + the harness's constants as keyword
arguments; an unknown key is a TypeError from the constructor — loud).
